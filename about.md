### Shannon Doser

I’ve been working in real estate since 2006 and am fortunate that I get to lead a talented group of Realtors that work together under the name Shannon Doser Group. Together we have helped thousands of people buy, sell, and invest in Real Estate over the past 15 years.<br><br>We strive to be a down-to-earth team that focuses on our 3 GUIDING PRINCIPLES:<br>● Serve with integrity<br>● Deliver on promises<br>● Give to others<br><br>While the industry has changed significantly in the past decade, we have focused on staying in front of technology. We realize that the REAL value we bring to our clients is through our expertise in the real estate process, and most importantly, our negotiating skills.<br><br>Anyone with a real estate license can open a door, search the internet, and fill out a contract. I don’t think you should be satisfied with that level of service! We are here to help people understand a process they may only go through once every 7 to 15 years. We will always be honest, represent YOUR interests, and protect you from making a mistake that could cost your family tens of thousands of dollars.<br><br>Over 90% of our business is generated from referrals by friends, family, past clients, and fellow agents across the U.S. That should be an indication as to what our priorities are and what our service is like. Our reputation is our most valuable asset and we never take it for granted. Thank you for the opportunity to earn your business!

### Linda Booker-James

A native of Brooklyn, New York and as an only child, my parents instilled in me that if you want something in life, you must work for it. So, I did exactly that. I worked hard, but that’s not to say I didn’t have fun along the way! After my 15-years of service, I found myself longing to do something other than nursing, yet equally important. I discovered that I had a real passion for real estate. I became an agent because I believe I can add value to people’s lives in this capacity. As my career in real estate advanced, I found there was a real need to help the veterans in the Kansas City metropolitan area. I honed my market research and negotiation skills in that direction which proved to set me apart from other agents.
