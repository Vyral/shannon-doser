Building a new house can and should be a monumental and exciting time in your life. It is important to make sure that you have a professional to support you during this experience. We learned the hard way that a new build contract protects only the builder, but with the support of a real-estate agent you can ensure that your rights will be protected. We encourage all those who are preparing to build a new home to consult an agent before you sign any paperwork. This will ensure that you are protected throughout the build process and during the warranty provided by your builder.

I challenge you to find a more passionate real estate agent than Shannon Doser! She is in a highly competitive industry and her drive to succeed and her ability to surpass her client’s expectations put her in the top in her field. I always recommend Shannon and if you have the pleasure of working with her, you will too.

Shannon and her team were wonderful during the buy and sell of our new home. Always on time, prompt and had a great, positive attitude. When she outlined the process, timing, pricing etc, it happened exactly as she had told us. Next time we sell and buy we will use Shannon and her team, couldn’t ask for a better experience! Not only did we get a great agent, but a new friend

Shannon was a life saver. She not only was able to get our house sold, but was very good at finding houses that fit our needs and our budget. I would certainly recommend her to prospective home buyers.

I am so delighted that we listed our home with Shannon and the Doser Group. The entire team was professional and knew the market better than anyone else. Not only did we get the price we wanted, it also sold in two days!!

You did an amazing job! You and your team go above and beyond, think outside the box and have an awesome knack for staging. Even with Cami on vacation and then during 2 major holidays, you guys were on the ball and were super responsive. Thank you for all of your help! I will be referring lots of people to you … especially the ones who think they want to sell by owner!!
