# Client Testimonials

*Linda Booker-James has been an invaluable asset and resource for our buying experience. She remained very communicative and responsive with all questions and concerns. Additionally, Linda was consistently and uniquely attuned to every concern or dislike we had and was always willing to explain, in great detail, to put us at ease. The competence and confidence Linda exudes is like no other and I would recommend her services to anyone, especially new buyers. Linda is an utter-delight; and my husband and I are honored to now consider her an honorary family member.*

\-Na'Ron H.

*My wife and I could not be more pleased with our buying experience with Michele and Linda. Professional, knowledgeable, and extremely in touch with our wants and needs, these are two top-notch agents in the KC area. We cannot stress how many times they went above and beyond to help us find our perfect home. Thanks to both, we are 100% satisfied and highly recommend Michele and Linda.*

\-Ron A.

*Michele was absolutely phenomenal taking care of us in a unique situation. She always responded to questions immediately and set up showings as soon as we liked something. She got us into the absolutely perfect home in just a couple months of working with her!*

\-Natasha M.

*Fantastic service, helped us close on a new build. Shannon and her team were always available, answered all of our questions in a timely fashion, and were always available day and night. Couldn’t have asked for more!*

\-Todd P.

*This was quite possibly the easiest purchase and sale I’ve ever experienced. Shannon and her team are top notch. Every question was answered quickly and we were always made to feel like we were being represented by the best in the business. We received over asking price on our home and paid a very fair price on our new purchase. All negotiated by Shannon. I don’t plan on moving anytime soon, but I always recommend Shannon and her team to friends and family who are in the market to buy or sell.*

\-April T.

*Absolutely the best experience I have ever had selling a home. Shannon and her team went above and beyond getting my house on the market and sold before it even hit the MLS. They are so very easy to work with and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a very professional and responsive company. I look forward to working with them in my future. An A+ rating for sure!!*

\-Lisa K.

*Karen Hill was both professional and personable.Our experience was somewhat unique due to the rather spontaneous choice to sell our home. With next to no time to plan, Karen managed to help us prepare by staging our home as well as hiring a professional to photograph it. Our home’s listing went live within 48 hours, and sold the first day it was listed.Additionally, Karen helped us navigate some speed bumps we’d not have known how to manage on our own.Without hesitation, I would recommend this realtor to anyone buying or selling a home.*

\-Robin K.

*Shannon and her team are very knowledgeable of multiple areas around Kansas City. They listen, pay attention to details and genuinely enjoy working with buyers and sellers. They make the home buying and selling process as easy as possible! Shannon worked tirelessly with us to help us sell our home and find our dream property.*

\-Zonna H.

*Shannon and team helped us sell our home and purchase two properties in a 60 day period. All closings and procedures took place smoothly and any questions or concerns were responded to in a timely manner with a great deal of professionalism. When partnering with this group you don’t just get a realtor, you get a team of professionals.*

\-Danny W.

*I worked with Chandra Ward specifically and had an AMAZING experience. Chandra made sure to make my buy and sell a seamless experience with as little stress as possible. Chandra was always available by phone and even went out of her way to do special things on Mother’s Day and for my dogs! I will be referring her to all of my friends and family and anyone that I ever come across that needs a realtor!*

\-Christa R.

*From the first time we met Linda, she has been so compassionate in wanting to help us find our forever home. There was never too small of a question to ask her about the process. Linda asked what we were looking for, and even included our daughters in the search. She never showed us anything outside of the area where we wanted to live and we have been here since May 1, 2020.*

*If you are looking for someone to help you, while you do your part as well, then Linda is the best person around. We continue to keep in touch to this day.Linda Booker James is top notch in our family's book.*

\- Sherry M.

*Michele is the absolute best! It is already so stressful buying a house, in this current market…try doing so 1400 miles away!! Michele made it so easy for us, as she took the time to really make it the same experience as if we were with her doing a walk through. She really went the extra mile and made the process seem so stress free in this crazy market we are living in these days! We are super happy and excited to begin our new adventure in our new home. We highly recommend Michele Harlow… she will help you find your perfect dream home!!*

\-Pat and Andy

*My husband and I had a very stressful start to our move from Denver to KC. Our journey with finding the perfect home was very daunting and nerve wrecking. We were not first time home buyers so we had an idea of what to expect but knew it would be difficult in the extremely competitive market after Covid. Low inventory & sky- rocketing prices made the search even harder. Michele was always ready to move on any opportunity we wanted, including finding and accessing homes pre-MLS. She went beyond what was required as an agent and her professionalism and service is immeasurable. I cannot thank Michele Harlow and Keller Williams enough for helping us find our DREAM home! Thank you so much!*

\- Jessica

*Michele, I can't thank you enough for your help and patience with me/us! I truly feel we couldn't have had a better Realtor! You were constantly there for me with your positivity, encouragement and especially your time! I appreciate you so much! This is an important step at any age and your competence and willingness to help us made it feel like we were your most important client.*

\-Dana and Brenda G.

*Michele unquestionably provides exceptional service and holds herself to the highest standards in the real estate industry. She was incredibly responsive and available at the drop of a hat in this fast paced market. I would recommend her to anyone looking to buy or sell their home and appreciate her candor and expertise.*

It is important to make sure that you have a professional to support you during this experience. We learned the hard way that a new build contract protects only the builder, but with the support of a real-estate agent you can ensure that your rights will be protected. We encourage all those who are preparing to build a new home to consult an agent before you sign any paperwork. This will ensure that you are protected throughout the build process and during the warranty provided by your builder.</p><p class="testimonial-author">— Wendy K.</p><hr /><div class="client-testimonial"><p class="testimonial-text">Shannon is a gifted communicator and negotiator. She gets the job done with determination and laughter. She is absolutely great to work with and she is funny!

Not only did we get a great agent, but a new friend</p><p class="testimonial-author">— Robin H.</p><hr /><div class="client-testimonial"><p class="testimonial-text">Shannon was a life saver. She not only was able to get our house sold, but was very good at finding houses that fit our needs and our budget. I would certainly recommend her to prospective home buyers.</p><p class="testimonial-author">— Shawn E.</p><hr /><div class="client-testimonial"><p class="testimonial-text">I am so delighted that we listed our home with Shannon and the Doser Group.

I had limited time to buy the house as we were living outside the US at the time of our house hunt. I only had a few days to pick something and start the process. She dedicated two solid days just for me and worked above and beyond to work out kinks for us after I was back in England. Thank you Karen for all your hard work!</p><p class="testimonial-author">— Cheri and James B.</p><hr /><div class="client-testimonial"><p class="testimonial-text">Karen is absolutely great to work with.

We could not be more satisfied and highly recommend Karen as your next realtor.</p><p class="testimonial-author">— Michael and Stacey J.</p><hr /><div class="client-testimonial"><p class="testimonial-text">Karen Hill is patient, helpful, and knowledgeable as a realtor. When my husband and I had trouble agreeing on a house, Karen mentioned finding the neighborhood that We liked best and choosing the home that way! This was helpful because one always wants to come home to the neighborhood they enjoy. Karen is always available, reliable, and thoughtful!! When we had 2 bids on the home of our dreams....Karen told us to add a note for the seller as to why we were the better bid....and we gratefully were chosen by the buyer!!!! When we began running into complications with selling our home in another state Karen took unexpected steps to move that closing along so it would not jeopardize the closing here in Kansas. Without her extensive wisdom and experience under those tough circumstances we might STILL be trying to sell our home and buy the one here! Thank you, Karen!</p><p class="testimonial-author">— Andrew and Rachel J.</p><hr /><div class="client-testimonial"><p class="testimonial-text">Karen Hill was amazing!! If it wasn't for her, our months and months of searching would have been for naught. We wanted the PERFECT home for our growing family, and she did JUST that! Definitely will be recommending her to friends and family!</p><p class="testimonial-author">— Mauricio and Dorinda R.</p><hr /></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
