    bio: >-
      Cami Savage is a real estate veteran in the Kansas City market. Having
      gotten her license in 2006 just prior to the real estate crash of 2008,
      she cut her teeth in a tough market where sellers felt they were losing at
      every turn and buyers were fierce negotiators. In her 1st year in real
      estate she was a Top 10 individual agent in volume sold out of a brokerage
      of over 2000 agents. In 2012 she put sales on hold for 3 years to take on
      the role as the CEO of a Keller Williams office and grew that office from
      78 to 135 agents and coached the top 20% of producing agents. In 2015 Cami
      stepped back into sales full-time and in 2016 partnered with Shannon
      Doser. In 2019 Cami closed $12M in volume with 98% of the units sold being
      past clients and referrals. In addition to selling, she also contributes
      as a coach for the agents of SDG and Associates with a focus on building
      their business around their database and referrals.

      A native of Brooklyn, New York and as an only child, my parents instilled
      in me that if you want something in life, you must work for it.  So, I did
      exactly that.  I worked hard, but that’s not to say I didn’t have fun
      along the way! In 1971, I joined the U.S. Air Force to continue my
      education.  I proudly served for 15 years and while serving, I received a
      Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing and served as a Nurse Midwife. After
      my 15-years of service, I found myself longing to do something other than
      nursing, yet equally important. I discovered that I had a real passion for
      real estate. I became an agent because I believe I can add value to
      people’s lives in this capacity. As my career in real estate advanced, I
      found there was a real need to help the veterans in the Kansas City
      metropolitan area. I honed my market research and negotiation skills in
      that direction which proved to set me apart from other agents. When I am
      not busy securing great deals for my clients, you can find me in my
      kitchen cooking, baking and conjuring up new recipes. I also enjoy
      dressmaking and reading. I currently reside in Gardner, Kansas with my
      husband. We are the proud parents of three sons and seven grandchildren. 
      Now that you know a little about me, I would love to get to know you
      better and put my skills to work for you!
