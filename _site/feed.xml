        <title>Q: What Is the Future of Real Estate?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVD7rOOzFRY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Positive change is coming, and we’re leading the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which each passing day, the world is changing. That statement couldn’t be more relevant than it is today, especially if you’re buying or selling a house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continuously strive for innovation, seeking new methods for how we can better the entire industry and improve your personal real estate experience. We’ve shifted our model to become virtually enhanced while still being physically available for our clients. &lt;strong&gt;So, from ‘just listed,’ to ‘just sold,’ we can work how you like to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can control the number of people who come in and out of your home. From the listing consultation, to the showing, to the signing of the contract, we can do it all from the comfort of your home, or in person—it’s up to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=So whenever you’re ready to move forward, we’ll be there.%20http://localhost:4000/q-what-is-the-future-of-real-estate.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“So whenever you’re ready to move forward, we’ll be there.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one visitor we know you’ll want in your home is our professional photographer, and you’re not even required to be there while the high-quality pictures are being taken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, the time is coming when buyers will make an offer on your house without ever physically stepping through the doors, and when that time comes, do you want your home represented through shaking, sloppy video and grainy photos? Or would you want your home marketed with our state-of-the-art equipment? &lt;strong&gt;Photo, video, drone footage, and even 3D virtual tours—we offer all of this because it’s the level of quality you deserve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At SDG &amp;amp; Associates, the experience we create is unparalleled. So whenever you’re ready to move forward, we’ll be there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want only the highest level of service, reach out to us via phone or email to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

There is also a half bath on the main level for the convenience of your guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ascend the staircase to the bedroom level and notice the delightful original stained glass window on the landing. The spacious and incredible master suite showcases hardwood floors, floor-to-ceiling windows with custom draperies, two closets, and a fabulous sitting room. The master bath features the original 1902 clawfoot tub that was reglazed in 2019.
