Our names are Shannon Doser and Cami Savage and we’re with SDG and Associates and Keller Williams Realty Partners. We have been in real estate in Kansas City for a combined 26 years and in business together for the last three-and-a-half years. We’ve worked with many of you one-on-one, and many of you have had the pleasure of working with one of our six talented associates: Michele Harlow, Karen Hill, Chandra Ward, Stephanie Vielhauer, Andy Olson, or Court Hendrickson.“Thanks to all of you, we had an amazing year in 2019.”We want to thank all of you for an amazing 2019. Together, we helped 90 families buy and sell their homes across the KC Metro. With nearly $28 million in closed volume, we’re proud to say that 95% of our business came from referrals, past clients, our trusted vendor partners, and the relationships we have with agents around the country.As we look forward to 2020, we are encouraged that national home equity is forecasted to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, which is great news for everyone.Throughout this year, you’ll be hearing from all of us as we share valuable info about the housing market, helpful tips for taking care of your own home, and special events that we’re hosting in 2020.If you have any questions for us in the meantime or any real estate needs that we can assist with, feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

			<p>I’ve been working in real estate since 2006 and am fortunate that I get to lead a talented group of Realtors that work together under the name SDG and Associates. Together we have helped thousands of people buy, sell, and invest in Real Estate over the past 13 years.</p>

<p>We strive to be a down-to-earth team that focuses on our 3 GUIDING PRINCIPLES:<br />
  ● Serve with integrity<br />
  ● Deliver on promises<br />
  ● Give to others</p>

<p>While the industry has changed significantly in the past decade, we have focused on staying in front of technology. We realize that the REAL value we bring to our clients is through our expertise in the real estate process, and most importantly, our negotiating skills.</p>

<p>Anyone with a real estate license can open a door, search the internet, and fill out a contract. I don’t think you should be satisfied with that level of service! We are here to help people understand a process they may only go through once every 7 to 15 years. We will always be honest, represent YOUR interests, and protect you from making a mistake that could cost your family tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Over 90% of our business is generated from referrals by friends, family, past clients, and fellow agents across the U.S. That should be an indication as to what our priorities are and what our service is like. Our reputation is our most valuable asset and we never take it for granted. Thank you for the opportunity to earn your business!</p>
