5343 Dearborn St, Mission, KS  66202

DARLING Remodeled Ranch Gem on an Oversized Lot!

This DARLING home sits on an oversized lot with plenty of outdoor living space that includes a NEW COMPOSITE DECK, a large patio overlooking the fenced in garden, and a playset that stays. The remodel of this 3 bedroom, 3 1/2 bath home extends beyond the work that was done 1-2 years ago that included a NEW ROOF, NEW kitchen with granite and stainless steel appliances, new carpeting, wood floors, and new 1 and 1/2 bathrooms.


  Visit Dearborn.SDGandAssociates.com to see all the details, images, virtual tour and current pricing.
  To receive info and pictures to your mobile phone, text “SDG4” to 79564.


In the last year, another full bath with DOUBLE VANITY and free standing tub with shower was added, a new grinder pump was installed, downspouts and sump pump discharge were buried, and the French drain was replaced.

A 19’ x 65’ double-wide driveway with new gravel provides excellent off-street parking. ALL APPLIANCES STAY, including the washer and dryer. HVAC was recently serviced and the A/C is just 3 years old. There are two outbuildings for plenty of storage for bikes, tools and lawn equipment.

The walk-up basement is modestly finished with painted walls, ceiling and flooring. Sunlight infuses the space to enjoy as a kid’s playroom, an exercise room, an office or even another non-conforming bedroom. ONE MORE large storage room is still available in the basement for all your boxes, holiday decorations, luggage, etc.

The laundry has a full size washer and dryer, storage for supplies, and pretty flooring to make the drudgery of laundry a pleasant one! The fireplace in living room is decorative ONLY. A water line was added to the left of the refrigerator with a turn knob to fill your KUERIG. :) There is also an outlet in the drawer of the double vanity to plug in your blow dryer! Yay!

        <description>

Positive change is coming, and we’re leading the way.

With each passing day, the world is changing. That statement couldn’t be more relevant than it is today, especially if you’re buying or selling a house. 

We continuously strive for innovation, seeking new methods for how we can better the entire industry and improve your personal real estate experience. We’ve shifted our model to become virtually enhanced while still being physically available for our clients. So, from ‘just listed,’ to ‘just sold,’ we can work how you like to work.

We can control the number of people who come in and out of your home. From the listing consultation, to the showing, to the signing of the contract, we can do it all from the comfort of your home, or in person—it’s up to you. 

“So whenever you’re ready to move forward, we’ll be there.”

The one visitor we know you’ll want in your home is our professional photographer, and you’re not even required to be there while the high-quality pictures are being taken.

The Churchill Condos is a modern 12-story building located in the heart of The Plaza, Kansas City’s upscale residential neighborhood and shopping district. Steps away from the Winston Churchill are 14 blocks of beautiful streetscapes boasting over 120 boutiques, local shops, and national retailers. Nearly 30 unique restaurants, cafes, and bars offer an incredible variety of dining options. Churchill amenities include a community penthouse, 24/7 fitness center, clubhouse terrace, secured garage parking, lush landscaping, pet-friendly living, secured entry, and additional storage.

This specific PREMIUM unit was originally two units remodeled into one large unit boasting warm and comfortable finishes, beautiful ebony hardwood floors throughout the kitchen, living room and dining areas, master suite with huge walk-in closet and roomy master bath, kitchen with stainless steel appliances, custom cabinetry, wine fridge, granite counters, walk-in pantry, and curved eating bar, office area, en-suite laundry, newer HVAC with zoned heating and cooling, and majority of window coverings are automated for easy opening and closing. As an added bonus, a frosted glass wall was added to create a media room that is perfect for watching the BIG GAME, like the Super Bowl or World Series!

There is tons of storage both in the unit and additional storage within the building, and two parking spaces in the secured garage are included with the purchase. It doesn’t get any easier to enjoy living on the Plaza than in the Winston Churchill, and this gorgeous premium unit with its 8th floor views to the south and east is the topper!

We had an amazing year in 2019, and with our new video blog, we&rsquo;re looking forward to an even better one in 2020. Here&rsquo;s what you can expect in the coming months.

 

We’re here to introduce ourselves, brag about our team, and celebrate our successes in 2019. Our names are Shannon Doser and Cami Savage and we’re with SDG and Associates and Keller Williams Realty Partners. We have been in real estate in Kansas City for a combined 26 years and in business together for the last three-and-a-half years. 

We’ve worked with many of you one-on-one, and many of you have had the pleasure of working with one of our six talented associates: Michele Harlow, Karen Hill, Chandra Ward, Stephanie Vielhauer, Andy Olson, or Court Hendrickson.

“Thanks to all of you, we had an amazing year in 2019.”

We want to thank all of you for an amazing 2019. Together, we helped 90 families buy and sell their homes across the KC Metro. With nearly $28 million in closed volume, we’re proud to say that 95% of our business came from referrals, past clients, our trusted vendor partners, and the relationships we have with agents around the country.

As we look forward to 2020, we are encouraged that national home equity is forecasted to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, which is great news for everyone.

Throughout this year, you’ll be hearing from all of us as we share valuable info about the housing market, helpful tips for taking care of your own home, and special events that we’re hosting in 2020.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime or any real estate needs that we can assist with, feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
