Welcome home to 18415 W. 193rd Street in the Estates of Wolf Creek Community of Spring Hill. This gorgeous home offers five bedrooms, three full and one half baths, and 2,790 square feet of perfectly inviting living space. This home has a BRAND NEW ROOF and updated lighting, and is ideally located in a desirable neighborhood, within walking distance to the elementary and high schools\!

As you approach the home, be greeted by a grassy front yard and covered front porch. Step inside the soaring 2-story foyer and notice the beautiful wood flooring, curved staircase with stylish iron spindles, open floor plan, and easy flow between living spaces. To your left is the formal dining room featuring a buffet niche, handsome light fixture, and picturesque window overlooking the front yard allowing natural light to grace the room.

Continue to the great room offering a cozy gas start log fireplace with stacked stone surround and decorative mantel with column accents, a refreshing lighted ceiling fan, and a series of generously sized windows providing views of the backyard. The beautiful wood floors flow into the fully-equipped eat-in kitchen highlighting rich and abundant cabinetry, gleaming granite counters with double undermount sink, full tile backsplash with mosaic accents, island with additional storage, walk-in pantry, and a built-in desk. Stainless steel appliances include the French door refrigerator, smooth surface range, built-in microwave, dishwasher, and disposal. The large breakfast area has a sliding glass door leading to the deck, making entertaining a breeze. Also on the main level is a powder room for the convenience of your guests.

Ascend the stairs to the primary bedroom level. The spacious master suite highlights a fabulous vaulted ceiling with refreshing lighted ceiling fan, and double doors open to the stunning spa-like bath showcasing a vaulted ceiling, a relaxing jetted tub, separate walk-in tiled shower, expansive double vanity, large walk-in closet, and large tile flooring. There are three secondary bedrooms, the second full bath with double vanity, tile flooring, and shower over tub, plus the conveniently located laundry room with included washer and dryer, on this bedroom level.

Downstairs is the finished lower level with rec room, 5th bedroom with lighted ceiling fan and full window allowing lovely natural lighting, and the 3rd full bath with a shower over tub.

Outside, you will love to entertain on the multiple outdoor living spaces. The raised deck with pergola overlooks the large and grassy yard, or take the stairs to the paver patio and fenced yard below. As evening sets, move to the fire pit with privacy landscaping and roast s'mores over the crackling fire. Under the deck you will appreciate the additional storage.

Additional features include an attached 3-car garage with openers and keyless entry, central heating and air, humidifier, a programmable in-ground sprinkler system, and the Estates of Wolf Creek also features a community pool.
