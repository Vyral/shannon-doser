<center>We had an amazing year in 2019, and with our new video blog, we&rsquo;re looking forward to an even better one in 2020. Here&rsquo;s what you can expect in the coming months.</center>

&nbsp;

We’re here to introduce ourselves, brag about our team, and celebrate our successes in 2019. **Our names are Shannon Doser and Cami Savage and we’re with SDG and Associates and Keller Williams Realty Partners.** We have been in real estate in Kansas City for a combined 26 years and in business together for the last three-and-a-half years.&nbsp;

We’ve worked with many of you one-on-one, and many of you have had the pleasure of working with one of our six talented associates: Michele Harlow, Karen Hill, Chandra Ward, Stephanie Vielhauer, Andy Olson, or Court Hendrickson.

We want to thank all of you for an amazing 2019. Together, we helped 90 families buy and sell their homes across the KC Metro. With nearly $28 million in closed volume, **we’re proud to say that 95% of our business came from referrals, past clients, our trusted vendor partners, and the relationships we have with agents around the country.**

As we look forward to 2020, we are encouraged that national home equity is forecasted to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, which is great news for everyone.

**Throughout this year, you'll be hearing from all of us as we share valuable info about the housing market,** helpful tips for taking care of your own home, and special events that we’re hosting in 2020.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime or any real estate needs that we can assist with, feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
