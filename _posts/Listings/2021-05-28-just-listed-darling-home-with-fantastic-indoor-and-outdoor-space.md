A grassy front yard with mature shade trees invites you to the expansive covered front porch spanning the length of the home. What a wonderful spot to enjoy a cool glass of lemonade while chatting with a friend on a lovely summer day.

Enter through the front door with sidelights and into the foyer. Take note of the enchanting window to your left with inlaid glass, the rich hardwood floors found throughout the home, extensive wood trim elements, and soothing color palette cheerfully welcoming you in. The first floor flows easily for comfortable living and entertaining, and the living room showcases a charming decorative corner fireplace, refreshing lighted ceiling fan, and windows overlooking both the front and side yards.

The hardwood floors continue through an archway into the formal dining room highlighting crown moulding, a lighted ceiling fan, and an enchanting bay window with cushioned seat offering extra seating or a space to relax in the southern exposure.

Adjacent to the dining room is the spacious kitchen showcasing abundant cabinetry and counter space, full mosaic tile backsplash, French door refrigerator, smooth surface range, built-in microwave, and large ceramic tile flooring. You'll also love the cute coffee bar station\!

From the kitchen, 15-lite garden doors open to the light-filled sunroom with walls of windows, a lighted ceiling fan, laundry area, and a door leading to the deck. Currently, the owners are using this space as a spare bedroom with a fold-out couch, and this room would also make for a sunny first floor home office. Also on the main level is the converted full bathroom with new shower, perfect for overnight guests.

Ascend the stairs to the upper level with unique bedroom layouts. The master bedroom features hardwood floors, recessed lighting, ceiling fan, make-up station or office nook, and even has room for exercise equipment. The full bath offers decorative wainscoting, and a shower over tub with tile surround. There are also two secondary bedrooms on the upper level, also with wood floors and ceiling fans.

Outside, gather with family and friends on the newer 12x12 raised deck providing wonderful views of the grassy and fenced backyard with mature shade tree. Take the stairs to the yard below where adults, kids and pets alike will enjoy recreating in this beautiful space. You will also appreciate the included storage shed, double gate entry to the backyard, off-street parking, and the central heating and air.
