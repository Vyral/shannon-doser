### Amazing Layout for Everyday Living and Gathering Friends & Family\!

Come FAST ... won't LAST\! This front-to-back split has great living space\! Stir up some chili in the LARGE KITCHEN with granite counters, an island with bar seating, plenty of storage, and a large adjoining dining area. What an ideal layout for both daily living and entertaining, and, since the kitchen and dining overlook the vaulted living room with fireplace, what a perfect design for gathering friends and family to watch your favorite team when the TV below is tuned to FOOTBALL\! Send the kids to the lower level REC ROOM with full bath and door opening to the fenced yard with patio and stairs leading up to a 10x22 DECK just off the kitchen.

Cute laundry is conveniently located on the bedroom level, just steps from the MASTER SUITE with walk-in closet, tray ceiling, and beautiful bath with dual vanity and shower.&nbsp;

Furnace is 1-year new, and A/C is only 5 years old. You'll also love the 15x22 unfinished basement area accessible from inside the home to store all your extra stuff ... solid built-in shelving is ready for your plastic bins. Need plenty of parking space, a work area with built-ins, and a place for that 2nd refrigerator?? MEET the huge OVERSIZED GARAGE\! PLUS, avoid the car shuffle in the mornings with the 3-car wide driveway with extra side parking pad\!
