Welcome home to 803 W 48th Street Unit 804, a spectacular upscale custom Winston Churchill condo with panoramic views of The Plaza and Brush Creek. The Churchill Condos is a modern 12-story building located in the heart of The Plaza, Kansas City's upscale residential neighborhood and shopping district. Steps away from the Winston Churchill are 14 blocks of beautiful streetscapes boasting over 120 boutiques, local shops, and national retailers. Nearly 30 unique restaurants, cafes, and bars offer an incredible variety of dining options. Churchill amenities include a community penthouse, 24/7 fitness center, clubhouse terrace, secured garage parking, lush landscaping, pet-friendly living, secured entry, and additional storage.

This specific PREMIUM unit was originally two units remodeled into one large unit boasting warm and comfortable finishes, beautiful ebony hardwood floors throughout the kitchen, living room and dining areas, master suite with huge walk-in closet and roomy master bath, kitchen with stainless steel appliances, custom cabinetry, wine fridge, granite counters, walk-in pantry, and curved eating bar, office area, en-suite laundry, newer HVAC with zoned heating and cooling, and majority of window coverings are automated for easy opening and closing. As an added bonus, a frosted glass wall was added to create a media room that is perfect for watching the BIG GAME, like the Super Bowl or World Series\!

There is tons of storage both in the unit and additional storage within the building, and two parking spaces in the secured garage are included with the purchase. It doesn't get any easier to enjoy living on the Plaza than in the Winston Churchill, and this gorgeous premium unit with its 8th floor views to the south and east is the topper\!
