### DARLING Remodeled Ranch Gem on and Oversized Lot\!

This DARLING home sits on an oversized lot with plenty of outdoor living space that includes a NEW COMPOSITE DECK, a large patio overlooking the fenced in garden, and a playset that stays. The remodel of this 3 bedroom, 3 1/2 bath home extends beyond the work that was done 1-2 years ago that included a NEW ROOF, NEW kitchen with granite and stainless steel appliances, new carpeting, wood floors, and new 1 and 1/2 bathrooms.

In the last year, another full bath with DOUBLE VANITY and free standing tub with shower was added, a new grinder pump was installed, downspouts and sump pump discharge were buried, and the French drain was replaced.

A 19' x 65' double-wide driveway with new gravel provides excellent off-street parking. ALL APPLIANCES STAY, including the washer and dryer. HVAC was recently serviced and the A/C is just 3 years old. There are two outbuildings for plenty of storage for bikes, tools and lawn equipment.

The walk-up basement is modestly finished with painted walls, ceiling and flooring. Sunlight infuses the space to enjoy as a kid's playroom, an exercise room, an office or even another non-conforming bedroom. ONE MORE large storage room is still available in the basement for all your boxes, holiday decorations, luggage, etc.

The laundry has a full size washer and dryer, storage for supplies, and pretty flooring to make the drudgery of laundry a pleasant one\! The fireplace in living room is decorative ONLY. A water line was added to the left of the refrigerator with a turn knob to fill your KUERIG. :) There is also an outlet in the drawer of the double vanity to plug in your blow dryer\! Yay\!
