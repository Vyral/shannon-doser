This impeccably built one-owner custom gem is today's DREAM HOME\! Showcasing a 20-foot stone fireplace with floor to ceiling windows overlooking a lush, award-winning garden and yard featured in Great Backyards Magazine, this reverse 1.5 story home provides your own private sanctuary just minutes from I-435. The flexible floorplan in this lovely suburban home provides a home office, home gym, great space for virtual learning, and a safe room, all sited on a one acre private lot.

This five bedroom, three full and one half bath home offers 5,738 square feet of gorgeous living space, completely remodeled in 2018. You will love the new Old World Provenza hardwood floors, new carpet, whole house speaker system and amplifier inside and out, new AC, new furnace, new water heaters, 8' solid core paneled doors, and plantation shutters.

Enter into the impressive formal entry with striking front door and soaring ceiling. The formal dining room features a luxurious custom Dennis & Leen Chateau Crystal chandelier and multi-tier ceiling treatment. The vaulted great room showcases a 20' grand stone fireplace and floor-to-ceiling windows with park-like views.

This home was designed around the spacious kitchen, perfect for entertaining with two prep sinks, under counter wine cooler, stainless steel appliances, new granite countertops, an island with eating bar, stunning artist painted faux finished cabinetry, and large butler's pantry. The breakfast area opens to the hearth room with fireplace highlighting a 100-year old hand hewn oak barn beam. A door from this area opens to the large rear deck.

Off the kitchen is the powder room for the convenience of your guests as well as the laundry room with extensive cabinetry.

The main level master suite features a European style cage chandelier set in a recessed tray ceiling, along with a bay window. The spa inspired private master bath includes heated floors, a whirlpool tub, an oversized shower room, an expansive double vanity, and sophisticated marble-like porcelain tile.

All four secondary bedrooms on this level feature walk-in closets, and there are two additional full baths, one being a Jack-and-Jill with separate vanity areas.

Outside is the award-winning back yard providing your very own park-like, lush oasis. Relax or barbecue on the raised deck or expansive patio.
