### Custom Designed and Built with INCREDIBLE Floor Plan\!

Welcome home to 524 NW Edgewood Trail\! This wonderfully MAINTAINED HOME is sited on an approximate half acre wooded lot and has an incredible floor plan for easy living and entertaining, along with a backyard view NOT TO BE BEAT\! Custom designed and built, special features and various heights of ceilings, including soaring vaulted ceilings, along with a walk-out basement, all make this home feel even larger than the 3500+ s/f of finished living space.

The LARGE KITCHEN with tasteful granite and all new (2 years old) appliances looks over the vaulted dining area to see a wall of windows with a VIEW over the deck into the beautiful treed backyard. Off the foyer is the flexible FORMAL DINING room with sophisticated wainscoting that also makes for a great office. The stunning GREAT ROOM showcases a soaring cathedral ceiling, cozy gas fireplace, and numerous stacked windows providing lovely natural light to this generously sized space.

The 1st floor MASTER also has a private deck of its own, a very nicely configured walk-in closet, and a large private bath with barrel ceiling, double vanity, and separate tub and shower. Every additional bedroom is generously sized with large closets (2 of them are walk-in closets) and built-ins or vaulted ceilings depending on the room. The second full bath includes a double vanity and separate water closet with shower over tub. Much of the first floor and parts of the 2nd floor were recently painted.

The walk-out lower level was finished with a large rec room and a third full bath with shower, still leaving plenty of storage with shelving AND a 14x21 workshop\!\! 50-year ROOF is only one year old, and the sewer line was completely replace in 2019. All mechanicals have been well maintained, and the home has been consistently monitored by a pest control company. Exterior of home was painted six years ago, and the deck was re-stained within the last year. YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS THIS ONE\!\!
