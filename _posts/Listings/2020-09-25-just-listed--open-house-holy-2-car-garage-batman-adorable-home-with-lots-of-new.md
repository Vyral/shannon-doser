Be greeted by a large front yard with a majestic shade tree inviting you to the covered front porch. Enter into the home and notice the hardwood floors found throughout the entire home - no carpet here - fresh interior paint, and easy flow between living spaces. To your right is the living room highlighting a handsome floor-to-ceiling white masonry fireplace, just in time for those cooler fall evenings, recessed lighting, crown moulding, and large windows overlooking the front and side yards allowing natural light to fill the room.

From the living room, the hardwood floors continue to the formal dining room offering crown moulding, another large window, and charming spherical chandelier lighting. A 10-lite door from the dining room leads to the side porch. Adjacent to the dining room is the darling, fully-equipped, kitchen featuring great cabinetry and counter space, full tile backsplash, refreshing lighted ceiling fan, refrigerator, gas range, microwave, and dishwasher.

The main level master bedroom highlights hardwood floors and refreshing ceiling fan, and the full bath features a shower over tub. Ascend the stairs to the second bedroom featuring hardwood floors and a vaulted ceiling with refreshing lighted ceiling fan. There is also a second full bath with walk-in shower, and the laundry area with included washer and dryer, downstairs.

Outside, spend time on the side porch oasis with lovely pergola taking in the views of the neighborhood, or follow the pathway leading to the expansive patio overlooking the large and grassy backyard. What a perfect spot for entertaining family and friends, and keeping your furry friends safe.
